parameters:
  table_id:
    ui-name: |
      App Runner table
    short-hint: |
      StringDataTable output by the App Runner app containing the results of running FBA
  mapping_id:
    ui-name: |
      App Runner attribute mapping
    short-hint: |
      AttributeMapping output by the App Runner app containing the results of running FBA
  fbamodel_id:
    ui-name: |
      FBA model
    short-hint: |
      The metabolic model consisting of genome-wide set of stoichiometric reactions, compounds, and the weighted components of the biomass on which you wish to carry out Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This model can be built using the “Build Metabolic Model” App.
    placeholder: |
      Model for FBA
  target_reaction:
    ui-name: |
      Reaction to maximize
    short-hint: |
      ID of reaction flux to maximize in FBA. Only one reaction can be selected. First you must deselect the default reaction 'bio1' and then select the desired target reaction to maximize. You may use the search box to search through the available reactions in your model.
  test_run:
    ui-name: |
      Test run
    short-hint: |
      Name (or index) of the test run to categorize
  feedback:
    ui-name: |
      Feedback
    short-hint: |
      Category of the result for a given test run

parameter-groups:
  param_group:
    ui-name: |
      Test run categories
    short-hint: |
      Categorize each FBA result as correct, incorrect, or unknown.
